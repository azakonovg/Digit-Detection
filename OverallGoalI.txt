I want to create a simple web app that allows to enter an image and detect what digit was displayed. I want that web to have a training mode where we train model using PyTorch and mode where we used the train model to detect a hand written digit. I was at web app to visualize the neural network with weights and biases at the graph so it's easy for people to understand. Application is the educational to for people to learn about neuron network. We will display examples of training data. We will visualize the model and will allow users to modify layers and number of neurons in each layer.
